/* Compute relative path between two path strings.
 *
 * This function is the equivalent of ut_path, but instead of operating on
 * objects, it takes strings as input.
 *
 * ut_path_offset will compute a path that, when combined with the 'from' path
 * will result in the 'to' path. For example, when 'from' is '/data' and 'to' is
 * '/data/foo', 'out' will be set to 'foo'.
 *
 * When both 'from' and 'to' are equal, 'out' will be set to `.`, as appending a '.'
 * to the from parameter would be semantically equal to 'from' (and thus 'to').
 *
 * When 'from' is not a parent of 'to', '..' will be added to the string to move up
 * in the hierarchy until the first common ancestor is reached. This behavior is
 * disabled when false is passed to 'travel'. In that case, when no common
 * ancestor is found, 'to' is copied to 'out'.
 *
 * When 'from' is set to '/', the resulting path will be relative to root and
 * will not contain an initial '/'. If 'from' is set to an empty string, 'out'
 * will contain an initial '/'.
 *
 * When 'from' is set to NULL, the function will behave as if an empty string is
 * provided.
 *
 * The function is O(n+m), where n is the length of from and m is the length of
 * to.
